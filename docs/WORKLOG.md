# Build Worklog

A running log of what shipped, by which agent, so we can resume where we left off.
Newest session at the top. See [decisions/DECISIONS.md](decisions/DECISIONS.md) for the rationale
behind any `D##` cited here and [decisions/TRACEABILITY.md](decisions/TRACEABILITY.md) for the
invariant→test status board.

## ▶ RESUME HERE (next session)

**Where we are:** Phase 0 (walking skeleton, per **D68**). The first brick — the `sqlglot`
column-provenance extractor — is **built, reviewed, fixed, and green**. Nothing else in the runtime
exists yet.

**Next brick:** the **ClickHouse MCP data plane** — the first *consumer* of the extractor. Building
it turns the `🟡 unit-green` rows (D57 live scope, D63 fail-closed, D64 scratch) toward `✅` by adding
their Component layer. It needs a **containerized ClickHouse** for Layer-2 tests (read-only
enforcement, scope-by-parse, `getTableSchema = introspection ⨝ catalog`).

**Open follow-ups carried forward:**
- The lambda fail-closed has a structural check (D70); the secondary body-walk cross-check still uses
  `find_all` — fine as belt-and-suspenders, but the **D62 `system.query_log.columns` oracle** (a
  Layer-2 job) is the real long-term validation of parser coverage. Not built yet.
- Local dev venv is Python 3.14; CI pins 3.12 (the `requires-python` floor). Consider a CI matrix
  (3.12 + 3.14) later.
- 6 coverage gaps accepted into backlog (see TRACEABILITY.md §Coverage gaps) — Phase-2 test additions.

## 2026-06-30 — Session 1: Planning lock-in + Phase-0 first brick

### Decisions locked this session
- **D68** — Three-phase delivery (walking skeleton → blueprints+verify with parallel learning loop →
  drift-defense fast-follow); **full** Layer-3 conformance suite gates release; conformance harness
  stands up in Phase 0 as a **red burndown**.
- **D69** — Column-provenance extraction contract (lambda fail-closed, `SELECT *` expand-and-reject,
  fully-qualified `(database.table, column)` USES pairs, session-gated scratch, EXPLAIN precondition).
- **D70** — Identifier matching is case-sensitive + exact; any unresolvable reference fails closed
  (no case-insensitive fallback, no silent skip); structural (non-tautological) lambda check.
  *Surfaced by the security review below.*

### Shipped artifacts

| Area | Path | Agent |
|---|---|---|
| Sequencing ADR + traceability registry | `docs/decisions/DECISIONS.md` (D68), `docs/decisions/TRACEABILITY.md` | `planner` |
| Parser test plan (36→39 cases) | `test-plans/column-provenance-extraction.md` | `qa` |
| D69 contract + OQ resolutions | `docs/decisions/DECISIONS.md` (D69) | `planner` |
| Project skeleton (uv/pytest/ruff, src-layout) | `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | `backend-developer` |
| Catalog-schema loader | `src/data_agent/catalog/loader.py` | `backend-developer` |
| **Column-provenance extractor** (D52/D62 — Phase-0 first brick) | `src/data_agent/sqlparse/provenance.py` | `backend-developer` |
| Layer-1 test suite (39 cases) | `tests/sqlparse/test_column_provenance.py` | `backend-developer` |

### Agent activity log (chronological)
1. **`planner`** — wrote the D68 sequencing ADR + created TRACEABILITY.md (35 rows / 18 decisions);
   surfaced 6 coverage gaps (invariants with no release-gating scenario).
2. **`qa`** — turned 11-testing.md §Layer-1 into a 36-case adversarial test plan for the parser;
   raised 5 spec ambiguities (OQ-1..OQ-5) that blocked implementation.
3. **Human** — resolved OQ-1..OQ-5 (incl. correcting an initial `SELECT *` choice that would have
   leaked out-of-scope columns); accepted all 6 coverage gaps.
4. **`planner`** — recorded the resolutions as **D69**; closed the OQs in the test plan.
5. **`backend-developer`** — scaffolded the repo + built the catalog loader, the extractor, and the
   36-case suite test-first. Green: 36/36.
6. **`reviewer`** — adversarial security review. Verdict **REQUEST CHANGES**: 1 Critical
   (tautological lambda check), 3 High (silent under-extraction on case-mismatch; `SELECT t.*` guard
   only incidental; test fixtures used phantom columns). Confirmed a real leak path.
7. **Human** — issued the case-sensitivity contract ruling (→ D70); resumed the agent for fixes.
8. **`backend-developer`** — applied all 7 fixes; structural lambda check; validating-qualify so
   case-mismatch raises; removed case-insensitive table fallback; explicit `t.*` guard; fixtures
   reconciled to production YAML; sqlglot pinned `>=30.12.0,<31`. Green: **39/39**.
9. **Orchestrator (me)** — independently verified (39 green, ruff clean, leak path closed, scratch
   isolation intact); recorded D70; updated TRACEABILITY statuses honestly (✅ unit-complete vs.
   🟡 unit-green where consumers aren't built).

### Verification status
- `uv run pytest` → **39 passed**; `uv run ruff check` → clean.
- Behavioral spot-checks (run by orchestrator): case-mismatch raises; `SELECT t.*` on uncatalogued
  table raises; own-session scratch passes; cross-session scratch raises; positive joins extract
  correctly.

### Traceability deltas (this session)
- `✅ green`: `D52-derived-column-in-uses-set`, `D64-scratch-parse-fail-closed`, all five D69/OQ rows,
  `D70-case-mismatch-fails-closed`.
- `🟡 unit-green` (unit slice proven, MCP/E2E consumers not built): `D57-derived-agg-over-forbidden-rejected`,
  `D63-parse-fail-rejects-not-runs`, `D64-scratch-cross-session-rejected`, `D52-per-consumer-fail-behavior`,
  `D44-parse-fail-drops-entry`.
